# Vector Field Histogram

This is an implementation of the [Vector Field Histogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Field_Histogram) algorithm, developed by J. Borenstein and Y.Koren in 1990.

I'm going to use this in a project for my real-time systems class at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, where we're using ARM microcontrollers. That explains why this is a C implementation (I also don't like C++).

## To do

+ Finish implementing the basic algorithm: functions to update the certainty grid and to retrieve a moving window from it.
+ Divide it logically in files.
+ Introduce some examples and test data.
